#Synopsis Analyzer/Transcoder

Synopsis is a metadata format for storing information about your content aimed at Interactive, Realtime, Performance and Installation arts and technologies.

This repo hosts a Synopsis Multimedia Analyser and Transcoder implementation written for Mac OS X.

Synopsis Analyzer is plugin based, allowing you to easily extend and experiment analyzing video and caching results for future use. Initial plugins are a simple Frame Counter and an OpenCV module.
